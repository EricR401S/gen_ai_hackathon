# Team 33 Compositive Drawing Generator

## Inspiration

With the global economic downturn in recent years, societal security has become an increasingly severe issue that urban residents are more concerned about. The crime rate is continuously rising, but the number of police officers maintaining law and order hasn't kept pace. When the police force cannot keep up, the rights and interests of citizens cannot be protected in a timely manner. Hence, the idea of providing self-help remote sketching services for criminals to judicial authorities was born.

## Workflow

![workflow](<Blank diagram (1).png>)

When a user fills out a form in the website, the app.py file on GitHub automatically generates a piece of text and sends it to Dalle. Dalle then creates an image based on this text and returns it to GitHub, where it is automatically downloaded to the local system.

## Advantages

This generator is designed according to the police sketching standards with 19 facial detail dimensions. Users can freely fill in the description for each part in the table, capturing the image of the criminal in their mind accurately. Moreover, as we used Streamlit to create our website, users can access this feature anywhere with WI-FI connectivity. From now on, if you are robbed or harmed, you can call 911 and immediately receive a URL link sent by the police. This allows you to quickly sketch the appearance of the perpetrator who should be punished before the memory fades.

## Challenges we ran into

During the process of establishing the portrait, we found that the table format used to help standardize user descriptions became a significant barrier in our communication with Dalle. The table merely lists the features of the portrait. It lacks emotion, fluidity of natural language, systematization, and theme. Dalle, being an artistic creation AI, returned very rough cartoonish images or even chaotic ones when provided with prompts lacking theme and color.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

After continuously adjusting our prompts, we thought of integrating ChatGPT into our prompt generation process, eventually producing more ideal portraits. Thus, we combined the table with the continues text generated by ChatGPT, ultimately resolving the fundamental communication issue with Dalle. We also noticed that if the output quality drops suddenly, it's likely because the prompt exceeded the 400-word limit, causing truncation and incomplete semantic expression.

## Inspiration

Throughout this project, we learned how to use Streamlit to create websites, establish interactive tables, and how to input data into Dalle and display its returned images on the website.
We understood how to fine-tune Dalle's prompts. We realized that prompts shouldn't be mere listings; they need to have a theme. While maintaining rigorous linguistic logic, the more complex the desired output, the more emotional nuance it should have.

## What's next for project

Due to the time constraint, we did not integrate the RAG database to help us better define AI's textual expression and standardize the establishment of prompts. This will be the focus of our project's progress in the future.
